- Dart SDK (included with Flutter)
- Android Studio or VS Code
- Emulator or physical device for testing

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AntoninKadrmas/talsec_flutter_project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd talsec_flutter_project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Languages

1. edit existing language files in `/lib/l10n` for example `/lib/l10n/intl_en.arb` or add new `intl_{lang-shortcut}.arb`.
2. all newly created languages add into `supportedLocales` in `MaterialApp` widget in `main.dart`
3. Navigate to the project directory and generate languages:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run intl_utils:generate
   ```

## Assignment

**Task Overview:**  
***Objective***: Create a simple mobile application utilizing the freeRASP library to inform users that it is not installed from Google Play using the onUntrustedInstallationSourceDetected callback.  
***Deadline***: 1 week  
***Submission Format***: Publish your appâ€™s code to a repository on GitHub and **send us a link to the repository**. Optionally, you can publish/send us the built application, but the code repository is enough ðŸ™‚.

**Suggested steps:**

1. Check the freeRASP README.md [https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Community](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Community)  
2. Choose your preferred platform and corresponding freeRASP flavor (Flutter, Capacitor, React Native, Cordova, Android, iOS) [https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Community?tab=readme-ov-file\#overview](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Community?tab=readme-ov-file#overview)  
3. Start new project (and git commit & git publish to your GitHub repository **regularly**)  
4. Integrate the freeRASP  
5. Utilize onUntrustedInstallationSourceDetected callback and warn user if app is not installed from Google Play Store

**Example projects (every freeRASP flavor comes with one):**  
Flutter: [https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Flutter/tree/master/example](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Flutter/tree/master/example)  
Android: [https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Android/tree/master/FreeRASPDemoApp](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Android/tree/master/FreeRASPDemoApp)  
Duplication of existing demo apps is **prohibited**. Otherwise, you can use any public sources, ChatGPT, StackOverflow, etc.

You should end up with app like this:
